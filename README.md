# MortgageCalculator
M = P x [R x (1 + R)N] / [(1 + R)N - 1]. 
These variables represent the following inputs:
M is your monthly payment.
P is your principal.
r is your monthly interest rate, calculated by dividing your annual interest rate by 12.
n is your number of payments (the number of months you will be paying the loan).
For example, imagine you have a $100,000 mortgage loan with 6 percent annual interest over 15 years.
Your input for "P" would be $100,000.
For "r," you would use your monthly interest rate, which would be 0.06 (6 percent) divided by 12, or 0.005 (0.5 percent).
For "n" you would use your total number of payments, one for each month in fifteen years, which would be 12*15, or 180.
